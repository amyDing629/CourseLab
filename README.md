## Purpose
As courses are transitioned online, students have an increasingly difficult time to meet new people in their communities, especially in courses with a large number of people. This has not been a new problem. In fact, even before quarantine, it can be intimidating for students, especially first years, to initiate conversations in a new class. This is especially true for larger classes. Therefore, we want to make an app designed for University students to meet like-minded people, and to build healthy, strong communities.

## Impact
According to our research, more than 95% of the students find the discussion of course materials with others important and more than 75% of the students think their learning experience will be improved if they can get to know more people in the course.   
With more involvement in their communities, students experience a stronger sense of belonging. This helps their sense of isolation and loneliness during this turbulent time, and their university experience in general.   
Our application addresses the difficulties of communication and socialization in online courses and large courses. Our application incorporates a new culture of communication by using personalized recommendations of friends. Students will have the opportunity to connect with peers with similar backgrounds and interests. Making friends in courses will become much easier. For people with English as their second language who have more difficulties communicating face to face, online socialization will also reduce the communication barrier.  
For certain groups of people, the benefits will be even greater. For example, disabled students cannot have access to classrooms. It becomes difficult for them to know their coursemates and the only tools they can access course materials is to read notes from noteTakers. With our app, they can find coursemates easier and understand more useful course materials.
